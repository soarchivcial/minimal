# sanitization/FUNDING.yml & Google's Style Guide for graphics toolkit with WebGL

**Make sure you `npm init`, or at least have a _package.json_ file before proceeding!**

## Installation
##### You will need _npm/npx_ installed. It will work on Windows, but just needs to be run in a bash shell, like VS Code's integrated terminal. 

1. Clone this repo somewhere on your machine, preferably in your home directory (~/), and _NOT_ in your app's directory.

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/user/test-blog-backend-controller style-config
```

2. Navigate to your app directory where you want to include this style configuration.

```
cd myApp
```

3. Run the shell script inside your app's root directory. (_The example below assumes you cloned this repo inside your home directory_)

```
~/style-config/test-blog-backend-controller-config.sh
```

4. The shell script added two config files

- .sanitizationrc.json
- .funding.ymlrc

This script follows this [tutorial](https://blog.example.com/style-guide) by Developer.
